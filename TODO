SmartPtr:
    required public dtor of iface - we need to disable such feature.
    Instead of this we need use the public dtor from base Obj class.
    Some weakness in a locking when we decrement object reference
    counter. Troubles can be in a SmartPtr dtor when reference 
    counter already decremented and lock has free state (!) in this
    time we destroy object if reference counter equal zero.

TaskFactory:
    The createTask() now has non-const parameter for Config*
    need to be a const.

TaskContext:
    Is very pure need more methods for supporting any common types
    like int,string etc.
    DONE: partitially see revision 152

ThreadPool:
    Lack of retrieving information methods:
	- is task with name ran
	- how many tasks in a pool
	- how many task with name ran
	- common statistic (maybe)
	- possibility of run task only in one instance
	  (like singleton object pattern)

need class TaskGroup:
    Inherited from ATask (or TaskAdapter?). Run the group of task.
    Take care about all task runned instances: wait for completeness,
    check error, restart if required and etc.

TaskListener:
    Need a distinctive method for destroy task event.
